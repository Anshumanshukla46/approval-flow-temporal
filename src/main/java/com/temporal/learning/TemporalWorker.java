/*
    WHICH BEAN IS CREATED FIRST AND WHICH ONE AT LAST:

    üîç This is called: Method Parameter Injection
        In @Configuration classes, method parameters act like dependencies, and Spring resolves them from the ApplicationContext.

        So even without any call like temporalService() inside temporalClient(), Spring still knows the flow via:
            Method parameter types
            Return types
            The entire dependency graph it builds at startup
 */
@Configuration
public class TemporalWorker {

//    If WorkflowClient is the brain of your app for Temporal‚Ä¶
//    then WorkflowServiceStubs is the nervous system that sends the signals over the network.

//    It doesn‚Äôt contain business logic ‚Äî it enables gRPC communication with the Temporal platform.

    /*
              Mainly for : WorkflowServiceStubs
              This creates a gRPC client in your app that can talk to the Temporal Server.

              WorkflowServiceStubs is Temporal's low-level SDK layer built over gRPC.
              It handles serialization, networking, retrying, and connection pooling.
              By default, this connects to the local Temporal server at localhost:7233.

              what it does:
                  - Creates & manages gRPC connection to Temporal
                  - Every communication to the Temporal Server

              üéØ Why needed:
              Because everything in Temporal happens via gRPC ‚Äî and this is your first step in establishing that communication pipeline.

              Without it, you cannot:
                  - Start workflows
                  - Send signals
                  - Poll task queues
     */
    @Bean
    public WorkflowServiceStubs temporalService() {
        return WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();   // Connect to local Temporal service (gRPC at localhost:7233)

        /*
            This line does not create the Temporal Server.
         Instead, it:
            - Creates a gRPC client that connects to an already running Temporal Server (usually on localhost:7233).
            - Acts like a remote control to talk to the Temporal Server.

         */
    }


    /*
        The WorkflowServiceStubs represents the gRPC connection to the Temporal Server. When you do:

        Internally, this does:
            - Uses the gRPC channel from service to talk to Temporal Server
            - Sets up the low-level connection management
        Prepares the client to make RPCs for:
            - Starting workflows
            - Sending signals
            - Querying workflows

        ‚úÖ Without passing WorkflowServiceStubs, the WorkflowClient wouldn‚Äôt be able to reach the Temporal server at all.

        WorkflowServiceStubs:
            - High-level API to start/signal/query workflows
            - Your app uses this to interact with Temporal

    /*
        üîß But What is WorkerFactory?
            - WorkerFactory is like a factory for creating Workers that:
            - Poll task queues (like OrderTaskQueue)
            - Run workflow implementations (e.g., OrderWorkflowImpl)
            - Execute activities (e.g., PaymentActivitiesImpl, ShippingActivitiesImpl)
            - Without it, no worker would be polling tasks from Temporal.

        üß† Why Does It Need WorkflowClient?
            - The worker needs to connect to the Temporal Server to fetch tasks.
            - workflowClient is what allows the WorkerFactory to get that connection info via WorkflowServiceStubs.
